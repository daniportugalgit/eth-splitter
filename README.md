# eth-splitter
Exercise: split your eth between two beneficiaries.

What

You will create a smart contract named Splitter whereby:

- there are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol.
- we can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the Web page.
- whenever Alice sends ether to the contract for it to be split, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol.
- we can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the Web page.
- Alice can use the Web page to split her ether.

That's it! This is where you put hand to keyboard.

We purposely left a lot to be decided. Such description approximates how your human project sponsors would describe the rules. As the Ethereum Smart Contract specialist, you have to think things through.

OBS:
1) Add unit tests.
2) You can leave the creation of the Web page to after you have been through the next module. Although, of course you can create one now. So when we mention "Web page" it is to give you an idea of the desired result.
